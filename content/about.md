## About me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

Frank develops software and computing infrastructure for large scientific
projects. At the moment he is rebuilding the system of descriptive information
required to process and analyze the data of the ATLAS experiment at CERN. He
also makes sure that raw data from the detector can be used for processing and
analysis.

## Research Interests
Particle physics has a long standing tradition of analyzing large and complex
data sets. Frank is interested in computing and software developments that allow
this analysis with greater ease. He would also like to apply the technologies
developed in high energy physics to other research fields which are just
starting to require networks of data centers to house and process their
information.
